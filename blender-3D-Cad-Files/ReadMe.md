# This is where I will store all my Blender and 3D Cad files
The Two Towers is the Blender file I used to model the 911 Twin Tower Fake Disaster video with.

The Modules are supposted to be from the that Fake 911 Investion, but from the Official Government web site, I downloaded it myself, and no reason to leave a link to it, just reaseach and find it, then compare them to make sure they are the same sizes.

The Video can be downloaded at https://github.com/Light-Wizzard/The-Principles-Of-The-Trinary-Universe/blob/master/misc/projects/911/The-2-Towers.m4v
